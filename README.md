This challenge consisted of using sales data from two different years and doing an analysis of the data.

The two data files are [athletic_sales_2020.csv](https://github.com/mikeyms1/athletic_sales_analysis/blob/main/Resources/athletic_sales_2020.csv) and [athletic_sales_2021.csv](https://github.com/mikeyms1/athletic_sales_analysis/blob/main/Resources/athletic_sales_2021.csv), which can be found in the [Resources](https://github.com/mikeyms1/athletic_sales_analysis/tree/main/Resources) folder.

The challenge consisted of using a [starter](https://github.com/mikeyms1/athletic_sales_analysis/blob/main/athletic_sales_analysis_starter_code.ipynb) file, and  then doing various data maniulations using pandas.

The final anslysis can be found in the **athletic_sales_analysis.ipynb** which can be found [here](https://github.com/mikeyms1/athletic_sales_analysis/blob/main/athletic_sales_analysis.ipynb).
